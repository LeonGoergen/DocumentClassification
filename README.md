# Introduction
This repository is dedicated to the field of document classification, a crucial area of study in the realm of machine learning and natural language processing. The aim of this study is to compare various document classification algorithms, including traditional approaches, neural network-based approaches, transformer-based approaches, and proprietary software. The comparison methodology involves evaluating the performance and cost-effectiveness of these models.

# Overview of Document Classification
Document classification is a method of categorizing documents into one or more predefined categories based on their content. It is a fundamental task in text mining and has applications in numerous domains, such as spam filtering, sentiment analysis, and topic labeling.

# Dataset Description
The dataset used for this study is the Consumer Complaint Database from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB). This U.S. government agency collects consumer complaints through formal, textual exchanges between companies, public institutions, and private individuals. The dataset represents a scenario similar to how private individuals typically communicate with businesses, providing a relevant and applicable context for the study of document classification.

The dataset comprises 3,218,032 consumer complaints sent to the CFPB with all required details and forwarded to the financial institution in question. The dataset was accessed on the 10th of January, 2023.

# Methodology
The methodology of this study involves several steps:

* Data Preparation: This step involves cleaning and balancing the dataset to improve its quality and ensure that each class is nearly equally represented. This process is crucial as it has a significant impact on the performance of the classifiers.

* Model Implementation: Various document classification models are implemented and tested, including traditional methods, deep learning methods, and proprietary software.

* Evaluation: The models are evaluated based on their performance and cost-effectiveness. The best-performing model, as determined by the evaluation metrics, is then compared against the proprietary software.
